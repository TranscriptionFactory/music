# music
A python package to make music and sounds
based in the [MASS] (Music and Audio in Sample Sequences) framework.
MASS is roughly a collection of psychophysical descriptions of musical elements
in LPCM audio through equations and corresponding Python routines.

Please refer to the article
[Musical elements in the discrete-time representation of sound](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6853)
for understanding the implementation and cite the work if you use this package.

### core features
* sample-based synthesis,
meaning that the state is updated for each sample.
(For example,  in a note with a vibrato, each sample is associated
to a different frequency.)
Thus, fidelity of the synthesized sound to the mathematical models is maximized.
* musical structures, with emphasis in symmetry and discourse.
* speech and singing interface.
* idealized to be used as standalone and for audiovisualization of data 
(e.g. for harnessing open linked social data in association to the participation ontology (PO)
and the percolation package, or with the audiovidual analytics vocabulary and ontology (AAVO)).

### install with
    $ pip install music
or

    $ python setup.py music

For greater control of customization, hacking and debugging, clone the repo and install with pip with -e:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ttm/music.git
    $ pip3 install -e <path_to_repo>

This install method is especially useful when reloading modified module in subsequent runs of music.

#### package structure
The modules are:
* utils.py for small functionalities (e.g. IO and conversions)
    - this file also imports all the example functions available in the MASS framework.
    These are in functions.py and include various synths, effects and utilities (envelope lines, etc).
* core/ with basic algorithms derived from the MASS framework. Imports all from:
    - functions.py: this file also imports all the example functions available in the MASS framework.
    These are in functions.py and include various synths, effects and utilities (envelope lines, etc).
    - classes.py: currently holds only the powerful class Being(), which will probably make the 
* synths.py have experimental synths not included in MASS
    - *NOTE*: one whoud check core.V\* synths to know about both most simple and most complex synths available.
    This module is very incipient compared to the MASS framework.
* effects.py for effects on a given PCM sonic array
    - NOTE: one whoud check core.\* for a number of effects, from tremolo and AM to spatial and spectral manipulations.
    Again, this module is very incipient compared to the MASS framework.
* structures/ for higher level musical structures
    - such as permutations (and related algebraic groups and change ringing peals), scales, chords, counterpoint, tunings, etc.
    - 
* singing/ for singing with eCantorix
* legacy/ for musical pieces that are rendered with Music (and might be appreciated directly or used as material to make more music)
* music/ for remixing materials into new pieces and for generating new pieces from scratch (with arbitrary parametrization)
* functions.py, a copy of mass/src/aux/functions.py, imported in music/utils.py
as 'from .functions import * ' but it should be integrated into music package more properly.

### coding conventions
A function name has a verb if it changes state of initialized objects, if it only "returns something", it is has no verb in name.

Classes, functions and variables are written in CamelCase, headlessCamelCase and lowercase, respectively.
Underline is used only in variable names where the words in variable name make something unreadable (usually because the resulting name is big).

The code is the documentation. Code should be very readable to avoid writing unnecessary documentation and duplicating routine representations. This adds up to using docstrings to give context to the objects or omitting the docstrings.

Every feature should be related to at least one legacy/ outline.

### usage example

```python
import music as M

pe3 = M.structures.symmetry.PlainChanges(3)
M.structures.symmetry.printPeal(pe4.act(), [0])

freqs = sum(pe3.act([220,440,330]), [])
isynth=IteratorSynth()
isynth.fundamental_frequency_sequence=freqs

pcm_samples = M.H(*[isynth.renderInterate() for i in range(len(freqs))])

```

#### idealized usage example
We didn't have the opportunity yet to make Music all we want it to be.
Here is an example of what one should be able to do:

```python
import music as M

M.renderDemos() # render some music wav files in ./

M.legacy.experiments.cristal2(.2, 300) # wav of sonic structure in ./

sound_waves=M.legacy.songs.madameZ(render=False) # return numpy array

sound_waves2=M.io.open("demosong2.wav") # numpy array

music=M.remix(sound_waves, soundwaves2)
music_=M.H(sound_waves[:44100*2], music[len(music)/2::2])

M.oi.write(music_)

```

### dependencies
The Python modules 
sympy, numpy, scipy, colorama, termcolor
are needed (and installed by the setup.py by default).

You also need to install sox and abc2midi (abcmidi package in Ubuntu).
The MIDI.pm and FFT.pm files are needed by eCantorix
and can be installed with:
  $ sudo cpan install MIDI
  $ sudo cpan install Math::FFT

or through your system's packaging system (e.g. apt for Ubuntu).

### further information
Music should be integrated to [AAVO], the participation ontology and the percolation package
to enable [anthropological physics] experiments and social harnessing:
- https://github.com/ttm/percolation

This means mainly using RDF to link between music package facilities and media rendering using diverse data sources as underlying material.

### deployment to pypi
This package Ñ–s delivered by running:
  $ python3 setup.py sdist
  $ python3 setup.py bdist\_wheel
  $ twine upload dist/

Maybe use "python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi" ?
